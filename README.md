## ‚ù° Install
### Dependencies
The following dependencies must be installed before it:
- ZSH: this is the shell the theme runs on. If you are on macOS, this is already the default one. On Linux, only a few distributions come with it by default, if that is not your case, you would need to change it manually.
- [**Rust Toolchain**](https://www.rust-lang.org): it will be used to build the project from source.
- **A font patched by the [Nerd Fonts project](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads):** it provides the pretty symbols used by the software. Alternatively, you can use the font containing just its symbols as a fallback to an unpatched one if your terminal supports. Avoid having multiple ones installed due to possible font conflicts.
- **A terminal with good unicode support:** it will be used to run the shell. It is highly recommended to use [**Kitty**](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty) due to its amazing features and traits required to render the fonts used in the theme.

Use your OS package manager or [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh) to install these packages.

### Procedures
- Apply the Nerd Font installed in your terminal.
- Install the theme using `cargo`. In case of an error, check `cargo`'s output for troubleshooting.

```zsh
cargo install river_dreams;
```

- Initiate the theme in `~/.zshrc`:

```zsh
echo 'eval $(river_dreams init);' >> ~/.zshrc;
```

- Reopen the shell.
