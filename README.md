## ❡ Install
### Dependencies
The following dependencies must be installed before it:
- [**Rust Toolchain**](https://www.rust-lang.org): it will be used to build the project.
- **A font patched by the [Nerd Fonts project](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads):** it provides the pretty symbols used by the software.

Use your OS package manager or [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh) to install these packages.

It is also recommended to use a terminal with great Unicode support avoid installing multiple Nerd Fonts for the symbols used in the theme to appear correctly. The terminal recommended is [**Kitty**](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty). You can download it by following the previous tip.

### Procedures
- Apply the Nerd Font installed in your terminal.
- Install the theme using `cargo`. In case of an error, check `cargo`'s output for troubleshooting.

```zsh
cargo install river_dreams;
```

- Initiate the theme in `~/.zshrc`:

```zsh
echo 'eval $(river_dreams init);' >> ~/.zshrc;
```

- Reopen the shell.
